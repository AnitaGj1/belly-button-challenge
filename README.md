# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, we should build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Instructions

### Step 1

> Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

### Step 2

> Create a drop down menu to select the Test Subject ID No.

### Step 3

> Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual which will show the OTU Labels when hovering over the text.

### Step 4

> Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

### Step 5

> Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
